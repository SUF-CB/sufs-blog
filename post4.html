 <h1>How to Achieve your Goals and Aspirations </h1> 
     <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/8bcbd8b9-dd15-4413-94c3-8e501cab257b%2F071adf08-6aed-463c-a66c-1ae4905d1a33.image.png?v=1616766585509">
  <div class="box5">
 <p>
All of us want to achieve the best and become successful! To get our selves to success we set ourselves goals and we have to build ourselves from bottom to top. 
    </p> 
<p>
  Sometimes we all struggle with achieving our goals may be due to effort... but I would say mainly for others and myself included, the one reason is the structure!
    </p>   
<p>
  One structure I use that is widely used in many industries is an acronym known as "SMART" I used this often when I was a project manager for a small project which I did at College because at the time I had a lot of college work which I wanted to be done to a high level as well as on top of structuring ahead for the project and becoming the best coordinator for my team.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      let me briefly explain what this acronym means ...
    </p>
    
    <h3>
Specific
    </h3>
   <p>
What do you want to achieve? what is your goal? 
 Whatever you do must always be thought with clear thought planning to keep your motivation levels sky high because if you fail to plan, you plan to fail! 
    </p>
   
  <h3>Measurable </h3>  
  <p>
It is important to measure your goals and No! this doesn't mean get a ruler and actually measure it lol...
you do this by setting yourself a realistic timeframe so ask yourself how long will this take? or in five year time where do, I want to be? by regularly keeping track of your progress, you will honestly feel motivated and content as you feel progression.
    </p>
 <h3>Achievable</h3>   
<p>
Ask yourself... is the goal that I want to achieve do able... will there be any constraints along the way that may slow or even prevent me from getting to my end goal..  in simple words be realistic and honest!
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Relevant
    </h3>
  <p>  
When setting your goal, think long term and ask yourself will this help me and give me a better life. Of course, you may not be sure. So, maybe ask family members or friends to give you advice...in other words think of the bigger picture and long term as well as short term!
</p>  
 <h3>
   Time-bound
    </h3>   
    
 <p>
Lastly, set your self a deadline so you can simply stay focused and get your task in hand done. Time is very precious, so value it because we all wanna look forward with satisfaction and not backwards feel regret and sorrow.
