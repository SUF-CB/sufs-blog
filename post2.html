 <h1>How to stay motivated during lockdown</h1> 
     <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/8bcbd8b9-dd15-4413-94c3-8e501cab257b%2F176474f5-8ff3-4a1b-8b63-739e2427dd64.image.png?v=1615558798014">

 <p>
It's never easy to stay motivated during this unprecedented pandemic! I'm sure you have all questioned yourselves on this constantly. I believe that I have the answers to this...
    </p> 
   

   <h3>
    1)Plan your duties and goals effectively 
    </h3>
   <p>
To stay mentally positive requires each one of us to plan our goals and priorities for the day. By achieving this, you will feel very productive and content with your self! 
When planning your day, split into small chunks. Let's face it, sitting down through one long session is hard. So, by separating, all your duties for the day into slots will prevent you from feeling stressed and will avoid you from sitting for too long without achieving much.
    </p>
   
  <h3>2)Learn a new skill or Improve a skill</h3>  
  <p>
Nobody is perfect at everything in life. So, by doing something new or improving it will keep your mind occupied and enable the brain to take on challenges and handle them in the best way.  At the end of it, you feel very accomplished and it will give you a boost to explore new possibilities to make you an even better person.
    </p>
 <h3>3)Get offline and Go outside!</h3>   
<p>
Of course, we have to stay inside during these unprecedented times...
This can affect peoples physical and mental health. So, we must all get some fresh air because going outside relieves so much stress and will raise your mood and motivation to continue your day!

    </p>
    <br>
  <p>  
To summarise, do what is best for you. Don't match your own level of expectations against another person's level of productivity. At the end of the day, everybody has their methods and speed of achieving their goals and priorities. Keep this in mind and remember to do everything to the best of your abilities and never give up on anything in life!
</p>  
    
    
 <p>
  One final message is please remain positive! I am certain this pandemic will come to an end. There is light at end of the tunnel!
