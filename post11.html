 <h1> What developer I would want to become</h1>

  <div class="box12">
    <p>
    In my last blog post, I briefly explained how I got into programming as well as pointers for people who want to get into programming and coding!

    </p>
 <p>
In this post, I will outline the job role by which I would want to become. But, first I want to give you a basic topology of what my potential role involves...

    </p> 

   <p>
In the coming years, I potentially see myself as a Software/Web developer. 


    </p>
   
  <p>
As for what the role involves being a software and web developer is similar in terms of the methodology of carrying out a project.
On the other hand, as for the aim, it's going to variey.
    </p>

<p>
So, a software developer aims to invent, manage, and optimize computer programs that run on desktops, laptops, smartphones, and other mobile devices. Using different programming languages ― such as Java, Python, C#, and SQL.
    </p>
    <p>
Whereas a Web Developer aims to be responsible for how a website or web application looks and functions, from its user interface and page layout to back-end systems for gathering data. Web Developers work with organization leaders to design unique and engaging websites for businesses, nonprofits, government agencies, and anyone else looking to communicate more effectively online. Web developers are also in charge of maintaining the performance of the websites and applications they create, ensuring users have a consistent and positive browsing experience. There are many languages used- such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP etc.
    </p>
  
  <p>  
 As for the reasons, I have many to tell you. However, out of all of them, I will tell my top 2. 
</p>  
 <p>
The first reason why I want to be a software/web developer is there is constant learning opportunities because technology is extremely fast-moving. So, software and web developers need to be able to learn new programming languages and technologies and adapt to the continually changing environment. Alongside learning about technology, developers will often have the opportunity to develop their knowledge about the business and sector they are working in, as these are also ever-changing. This constant change is an amazing learning opportunity, keeping your mind fresh and this is what I enjoy.
    </p>   
    <p>
     The final reason is there is creativity and basically showcases your talent! Software and web development is always a highly demanding creative profession. When you have written your first program you have created something new and you feel proud, surpassed and now you feel motivated to learn that language more. You can assemble another program with your own ideas. Similar to when I used to assemble Lego together when I was young!
    </p>
<p>
 
So, to summarise this is my vision as to what I see myself in years to come. In my next post, I will explain the process of a software and web project using my own programs and websites to show the involvement of being a developer!
