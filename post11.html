 <h1> The daily life of all Muslims (Ramadhaan edition)</h1> 
     <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/8bcbd8b9-dd15-4413-94c3-8e501cab257b/ramadan-3384043.jpg?v=1680280625617">
  <div class="box12">
     <p>
    On April 16th 2021, I briefly talked about Ramadhaan and some of the questions people have asked me and many other Muslims around the world. Ever since then, people now ask me what time I get up for breakfast and What time can I eat again?

    </p>
 <p>
In this post, I will break down mine and many other Muslims around the world's normal day in this blessed month of Ramadhan.
    </p> 

   <p>
Before any Muslim begins fasting in Ramadhaan, the moon has to be sighted in Saudi Arabia, if the moon is not spotted, then Ramadhaan will begin 24 hours after the moon sighting after sunset. However, if the moon is spotted in Saudi Arabia, Ramadhaan will begin after sunset. 
     


    </p>
   
  <p>
Let me explain an example: This year's Moon sighting was on Tuesday 21st March-the moon was not sighted so Ramdhaan began Wednesday 22nd March after sunset.

    </p>

<p>
However, if the moon was sighted on Tuesday 21st March, Ramadhaan would have begun on the Tuesday after sunset. Now, In Islam, we believe the new day begins at sunset and ends before sunset on the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
Ramadhaan has now begun on Wednesday 22nd March and we have done our post-sunset prayers known as "Magrib". From then on every Muslim is now in Ramdhaan mode. 2 hours after sunset prayers are the Evening prayers known as "Esha". After that is an extra 20 prayers which last over an hour and this is compulsory for every Male and female who is fasting. These prayers are led by students and imams who have memorised the entire Quran. These prayers are known as "Taraweeh Prayers".
           
      
      
      
    </p>
  
  <p>  
After these prayers, we resume our evening as normal and then each Muslim has to get up in the middle of the night before the Early morning prayer start time. This morning prayer is known as "Fajr". Before the prayer starts, all Muslims should have something to eat and drink to give them energy during the day. Once that is done all Muslims should then perform their Fajr morning prayer and then continue their morning as normal followed by both afternoon prayers known as "Zhur and Asr".
</p>  
 <p>
After Asr prayers, all Muslims should prepare to break their fast this is known as "iftar". Usually, after the Asr prayer, there is about an hour and a half till iftar. So, during that time Muslims should recite the Quran and pray to Allah (God) 10-15 minutes before iftar. This is known as "Dua".
    </p>   
    <p>
After this, all Muslims will hear the call to prayer, which is known as "Azaan". Once you hear this, all Muslims are free to eat again. Usually, everybody breaks their fast with Dates and water as the Azaan finishes within 5 minutes. After the Athaan people will read their post-sunset prayer known as "Magrib". Once this is done, people can then carry on with their normal evening meal. 
    </p>
<p>
 
Then, we start preparing and reading our evening prayer known as "Esha" followed by our Taraweeh prayers. Then we repeat the same process for the remainder of the month!
