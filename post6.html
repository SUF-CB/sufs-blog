 <h1>How I became a manager</h1>

  <div class="box7">

    </p>
 <p>
Before Covid, I was working at my college as well as studying their full time... 
    </p> 

   <p>
The college wanted me and a team of five to make an app for the college where students, adult and carers could access useful academic information such as; attendance, Class timetables and College Campus information etc... Of course, it came to an end quicker than expected which I'm sure you can all guess :(  
    </p>
   
  <p>
So... my role within this work I was doing was a project manager! 
But I have to admit I was never expecting myself to even be a manager at such a young age... I always thought to myself and had a vision that I would be a manager when I gain more experience and when I have reached the peak of my career.
    </p>

<p>
So... for me, this was probably a big achievement of 2019
anyways... when I saw this vacancy, I was ready to go all out for this and also a mobile app is something I wanted to do and thought YOLO so why not go for it...
    </p>
    <p>
      
    I filled my application and then several days later I got called for an interview with the manager of this project and also the head of computing! </p>
  
  <p>  
At this moment I prepared my answers and ... also physically drew my vision of how the app could have looked and so I believe this was one reason I became manager... I planned !!
</p>  
 <p>
I also came across as very determined... in my interview, I was very clear that I wanted to have this opportunity and that I would give everything to my team and also sacrifice free time to do my best always!
And, I also was very solution-orientated and logical meaning when I was asked about different situations, I would always give the most appropriate action within the moment of hardship.
    </p>   
    
 <p>
So... yeah this is why I believe I became manager...
This was overall really an amazing experience, I learnt a lot. Everyone was very enthusiastic and liked my communication of vision of how our app could have been...:(
    </p>   
    <p>
      I'm gonna be honest, being a manager wasn't easy considering the pressure and emotion behind my the scenes of my life I had at the time. There was a big personal challenge that I got through! I got through it and continued to deliver my all to my teammates! 
I am very grateful for having this opportunity!
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarise, whatever opportunity you want to do comes up, take it because that may be one of the long term roles you aspire to be! to get your foot through the floor plan your vision as if you were in that role. If it's something like technology-based or even construction based draw your thoughts why? because a picture is worth a thousand words! right...
Also, go with determination and good intentions. Do something with the intention of happiness and passion as well as learning and progression for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! one more thing let me confess I didn't nor my team made a quid from this! it's not always about money and money never buys happiness!
