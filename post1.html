 <h1>Why I am beginning to blog</h1> 
     <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/8bcbd8b9-dd15-4413-94c3-8e501cab257b%2F03c0a2bc-7b90-4222-93f5-6066ca77a490.image.png?v=1614899703546">
  <div class="box1">
 <p>
   I’m sure you are all wondering why he is beginning to blog. Well, let me tell you.
First, let me educate the people who don’t know what a blog is. A blog is an online website that showcases information, news, awareness, etc.
They are mostly a single page and can be aimed at many varieties of different audiences. The subject of the blog can be anything you want it to be.

    </p> 
   
 <p>
   Therefore, my blog will be about general things to keep my audience engaged and I will be posting monthly! If you were to look at my blog at any moment, you can see March and April have been weekly. However, as from May onwards, I will be blogging monthly so I can focus on other things which I want to achieve as lockdown is over and also Ramdhaan is ending shortly...
    </p>  
   
 <p>
   Okay, onto the main point, why have I began blogging?
There is always something to learn every day. I’m going to confess that I sometimes spend too much time on social media. I’m sure everyone agrees that when nothing is interesting on social media we have that regret that why I just wasted my time. Before you know it another day is gone and another day begins and it’s the same old….
Also in lockdown, we can’t really go out and take pictures and videos to post...

    </p>  
 <p>
   
I’m going, to be honest I was not happy with myself time-wasting and letting days go by without completely being productive 24/7.


    </p>  
   
   
<p>
    I thought to myself recently that at times I need to be more productive and so, me being into IT, I thought why don’t I make a blog by using my skills. So, I can actually use my social media more productively rather than doing the same old because it’s boring.
I did some research to find out to see what benefits I gain from doing this. Because let's face it if you do something that makes you gain nothing, you are time-wasting which leads to a lack of productivity once you find out the reality.</p>   
   
  <p>
    Here are some of the benefits:
    </p> 
   <h3>
     “You get better at writing”
    </h3>
   <p>
    I don’t claim to be a good writer. However, through blogging each word can naturally be within your own self and thoughts. So, in many ways, it is good because many people can understand you much better. Of course, not everyone will get you. However, over time with practice, this will improve. 
    </p>
   
  <h3>“Educating people”</h3>  
  <p>
    I think we can all put our hands up and say we don’t claim to everything. I can tell you now I certainly don’t! Many blogs can inspire others and certainly make people aware of things going on. I firmly believe that I will make an impact over time and hopefully clarify certain topics and subjects where people may have not so much knowledge.
    </p>
 <h3>“High growth of online presence”</h3>   
<p>
  One of the greatest benefits of blogging is connecting with others. Of course, you will gain new followers. But you also build a good and positive connection. This is important in these times because people will be going through different moods.
    </p>
    
  <p>  
Now that I am beginning a new hobby. I feel happy and I certainly feel my days are being utilized better, which is a huge positive in my eyes.
To summarise, I understand that the situation we face is very hard. So, trying to occupy yourself in doing something is not easy.
</p>  
    
    
 <p>
    So, a message to all my audiences is first of all, I hope all is well and secondly if you are feeling bored, try and do something new. It does not need to be blogging, it can be anything you want be it to be that will make you feel good and happy about yourself.
