 <h1>Islam around the world today</h1> 
     <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/8bcbd8b9-dd15-4413-94c3-8e501cab257b%2F7c293de2-5f99-4901-b28f-ac0216984c6a.image.png?v=1620493309187">
  <div class="box10">
    <p>
  We are all on social media and some of us are aware that there is a lot of difficulties, destruction and poverty in certain areas of the world. 
    </p>
 <p>
Alhumdulillah, we have all done some much goodness and worship throughout this Ramadaan for ourselves, families, friends and relatives...
    </p> 

   <p>
But what about our other Muslims around the world?

    </p>
    <p>
      Below is a short brief of what is happening in the world right now...
      I know there is alot more places than these who may be suffering. So, I appologise and if you would like me to add a certain city which you feel the people need to be educated as to what is happening. please reach out to me on my socials which is the dark red box when you scroll down to the bottom at the main homepage of my blog!
    </p>

  <div class="box101">
  
      <h3>Palestine</h3>
     
      <p>A small province known as Sheikh Jarrah in Jerusalem is being destroyed by Israelis who want to wipe-out Palestine

</p>
      <p>
        Many Palestinians are being forced out their homes as well as being killed and being severely hurt
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only this… worshipers of masjid ul Aqsa were wounded, killed and were also trapped inside

      </p>
    
<br>
        
      <h3>Yemen</h3>
     
      <p>Yemen currently has a large humanitarian crises in the world</p>
          <p>
            Many of the young children are malnourished because their families cant get food due to poverty

          </p>
  <p>
    This is causing so many deaths 

          </p>
    
    <br>
         
      <h3>Uyghur Muslims</h3>
  
      <p>Millions of Muslim children are being separated  from parents and are being put into camps</p>
              <p>
                China is making our own Muslims slaves for china manufacturing 

              </p>
    <p>
      Women are also being abused and extremely mistreated in concentration camps

              </p>
    </div>
  
    
    
  <p>
They are still one of us, they have been sent down and will return to Allah like all of us!
    </p>

<p>
I want to keep it short and sweet... What can we do on our part?
    </p>
    <p>
Regarding these worldly issues with Islam, we must pray for all our Muslim brothers and sisters and also thank our benevolent Allah who has blessed us with so much which others may not have...
    </p>
  
  <p>  
Praying for someone can be done at any time, I can guarantee each one of us can make a difference for every Muslims around the world...
</p>  
 <p>
Another thing we can do is give Charity...
    </p>   
    <p>
In Islam Charity is very important as in today's society, there are many Muslims around the world who are living in poverty with not even basic human needs. 
    </p>
<p>
Also, it can be any amount of money... Allah will reward you for whatever intention you give!
    </p>
    <p>
      A final note is nobody needs to be a muslim to stand up for islam, So we must all come together and help everyone who is going through harship and make people aware of what is going on because we can all make a difference in some way...
