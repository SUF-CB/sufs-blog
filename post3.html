 <h1>Qualities that Employers Value Most</h1> 
     <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/8bcbd8b9-dd15-4413-94c3-8e501cab257b%2F6b93c2c3-7dca-4950-8347-f67dea73bd19.image.png?v=1616166269665">
  <div class="box4">
 <p>
Employability skills are crucial when it comes to getting a chosen job which you will enjoy, as it is very demanding during this day and age.  There are certain qualities and attributes which will require you to become successful during any job so tasks and commands can be full filled successfully to the highest level. Below I have explained briefly the qualities that I believe employers value the most.
    </p> 
   
   <h3>
  Strong Communication Skills
    </h3>
   <p>
The single most important trait that most employers look for is effective communication. People who can articulate their thoughts have an edge over others who can’t. Employers highly prize both written and verbal communication skills. The ability to convey your ideas clearly and speak confidently with your bosses is an important part of your professional life.
    </p>
   
  <h3>Intelligence</h3>  
  <p>
No doubt intelligence is one of the prime qualities that an employer looks for in an employee. Studies have shown that the productivity of an employee is directly proportional to intelligence level. Intelligence is not just about a high IQ score – it’s an employee’s underlying ability to tackle complex tasks, plan well, multitask, prioritize and organize their work properly. An intelligent employee knows how to practically tackle problems that arise in day-to-day tasks. 
    </p>
   <p>
     As a candidate, a good way of showing your intelligence is to show curiosity and ask questions that are relevant to the job. 
Asking good questions and listening fully to the answers will make you look smart.
    </p> 
    
    
 <h3>Integrity</h3>   
<p>
Integrity is also one of the qualities that employers value most in their employees. It is an important trait to have for ensuring long-term success in your career, and in life in general. Integrity comes from within and is a deep-rooted value. It begins with being honest with yourself, which helps you grasp the importance of being honest in your dealings and relationships with others. Integrity is a trait that not every employee has, and therefore it’s highly valued in the workplace. When combined with other qualities, an employee with integrity is bound to be highly regarded by the employer.

    </p>
    
   <h3>Leadership</h3>
  <p>  
Every organization needs leaders who can take initiative, and effectively move the team and business forward. Leadership is about not being afraid to take charge and accepting accountability for the results. Leaders do not make excuses or try to escape challenges. They embrace challenges, and even thrive on them. It is said that leaders are not built, they are born. However, it is the attitude that you develop over your entire life that makes you a true leader. If you have this trait, you are sure to be an asset to any organization.
</p>  
 
    <h3>Responsibility</h3>
    
 <p>
Many employees feel they just need to do enough work to get by, to justify their employment. However, some employees take that extra step and assume complete responsibility for the work they are doing. They don’t just look at their work, but also think from the employer’s point of view, and even the customer’s point of view, and try to deliver results that are in the best interests of the whole organization. These are team players, who are aware of their responsibilities to their co-workers. Such people are rare and should be rewarded and valued in any organization.
    </p> 
    
    
      <h3>Strong Planning and Organization Skills</h3>
    
 <p>
Odds are that any job you take will involve managing multiple tasks at the same time. You will need to organize yourself, plan project timelines and meet specific deadlines.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Even if you have a system for planning and organizing your efforts, if your desk looks like a tornado just hit it, you will be perceived as disorganized.
    </p>
    
        <h3>Confidence</h3>
    
 <p>
Self-confidence is a big advantage in any field. If you don’t have confidence in yourself and your abilities, no one else will. Confident employees have a strong belief in themselves, and they strive hard to solve problems in the workplace. Confidence indicates that you can handle the team efficiently and become a good leader.
