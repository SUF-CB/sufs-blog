      Year by Year the greatest and most peaceful month approaches every Muslim in the entire world! Wherever we are in the world and whatever occupation we do, Fasting is absolutely compulsory from when you are a teenager...
    </p>
 <p>
As a teenager, fasting in school/college and uni, we all get asked many questions by our friends and teachers such as... Can you drink when fasting? Can you chew gum? How long cant you eat and drink? How long is Ramadhan? and the common are You hungry/thirsty?...
    </p> 

   <p>
So... I will briefly explain the concept of Ramadhan to all the people...
First of all, Ramadhan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. There are many purposes of this month such as abstaining from all food and drink, for 16-17 hours, but also connect ourselves spiritually by reading the holy Quraan and punctually reading five-times daily prayers including late evening prayers.

    </p>
   
  <p>

 I believe the main purpose is to have full consciousness and to be mindful of our actions and words which may displease and anger Allah.
    </p>

<p>
For example, you could be in school and someone is annoying you... because you feel the need to react and your thinking about swearing. But all of sudden you realise .... No! I can't do this as this will anger Allah. So, thinking before you speak as they say is essentially being aware which is an Islamic word called Taqwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      So... what can we do when fasting
In simple terms worship and please Allah... How... five times prayers (including late-night prayers), recitation of the Holy Quraan, Remembering Allah (zikr), early morning prayers (Tahujud), giving to charities etc...
    </p>
  
  <p>  
If anybody sins, they must immediately repent and seek forgiveness.
So, at the end of the month of fasting. We have our Eid celebration where we thank Allah for helping us get through our Ramadhan! 
</p>  
 <p>
This is what Ramadhan briefly explained, If there are any questions related to this from any non-Muslims, then you can message me on my social media page and I will get back to you!
