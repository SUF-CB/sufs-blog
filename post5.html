  <div class="box6">
 <p>
We all want a career in something we are passionate about right... employees that suit an organisation are not easy to find... selecting the wrong candidate can be costly... In this post, I will talk about some of the attributes I believe make a good employee... let's Begin!
    </p> 


    <h3>
Listening Attentively
    </h3>
   <p>
Firstly,it's very important to pay attention as it shows the managers that people are showing interest in what they are saying by showing you’re interested, you should also be able to communicate as it creates empathy and stable relationships between other work colleagues in the job environment sector as you interact with each other in problem-solving & teamwork.   
    </p>
   
  <h3>Working independently</h3>  
  <p>
Employees should be able to work independently by trying to identify where you can become an even better person, for example, you may try persevering with different skills to solve a challenge... or by doing extra research on a topic you don’t understand or you may try to improve yourself. When it comes to teamwork, for example trying to communicate with other people by asking more questions, to gain a wider understanding of a particular topic or a skill.  
    </p>
 <h3>Good Maths and English skills</h3>   
<p>
You should also be able to do basic maths and English by doing basic adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing, you should also be able to analyse tables and charts. As for English, you should also be able to write essays and letters by using good formal English, spelling and grammar. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>
Caring
    </h3>
  <p>  
Every employee should be naturally caring as some of your work colleagues maybe have certain illnesses and health issues, which may prevent them from carrying out a task, therefore you should use your initiative to support and help that person in a professional way, so they can full fill there acquired job without any difficulties. As a result of this, this will create a good bond between other work colleagues in the job.
</p>  
 <h3>
Health and safety
    </h3>   
    
 <p>
Lastly,good health and safety is important in any job environment as there could be assets being carried around, therefore the person who is carrying the equipment should be aware of people around the environment. There can also be work colleagues who are disabled and are in wheelchairs, therefore the other people can help the disabled by holding the door for them or by helping and guiding them through busy passageways or taking them to the lift if they have belongings to carry.
