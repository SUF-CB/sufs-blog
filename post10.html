 <h1>How I began Coding/</h1> 
   <h1a>Programming</h1a> 
     <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/8bcbd8b9-dd15-4413-94c3-8e501cab257b%2F877e7be2-3cf1-4dd5-8775-f70e857ab94c.image.png?v=1625061599113">
  <div class="box11">
    <p>
    I began coding/programming in 2018 at college as it was part of my course... So, I had my lecturers and peers to track me in the right direction to potentially become some sort of developer, which you will all find out in my next blog post as to what developer I would want to become...
    </p>
 <p>
Eventually, as the year went by I began to understand coding/programming and I gained a basic topology of the methodologies that make projects in the world of reality deliverable and successful!
    </p> 

   <p>
So... regarding this, I began to have a general passion and to this day I code my own programs. I will probably continue this till I am potentially working as a developer... The reason for this is to show employers my passion and interest in what I want to do in the future... 

    </p>
   
  <p>
I also feel that by using my innovation is kind of a springboard to move myself up the ladder and go beyond my potential when I enter the world of work very soon :)
    </p>

<p>
That's my story! 
    </p>
    <p>
But as for my people, If you know somebody who wants to code/program or maybe yourselves! Here are a few pointers...
    </p>
  
  <h3a>  
1) You don't need a specialist to teach you coding/programming! 

</h3a>  
    <p>
      There are many websites and apps which cover the same principles.Some of the websites I use now are:
    </p>  
    <h2>
      W3 schools
    </h2>
      <h2>
    Udemy
    </h2>
      <h2>
     LinkedIn Learning
    </h2>
    <br>
<h3a>
  2) Begin with Python!
    </h3a>
  
<p>
 Python is easy to pick up, most of it reads like English and is simple for noobs LOL!! for real though it's a good starting point to build you up...
    </p>
    <h3a>
      3) Be Consistent and Practise!
    </h3a>
    <p>
      If you are reading this and so far you are disinterested... Use this tip!
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever you do, if you wanna be the best at something, always show up because if you don't you will lose what you gained and you can't go back. So, make each day count and as for the practice... To all the new/ current programmers and coders practise keeping the flow, as we all know practice makes perfect!
