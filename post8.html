 <h1>The daily life of all Muslims</h1> 
     <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/8bcbd8b9-dd15-4413-94c3-8e501cab257b%2F27fc8288-968e-4db3-a84b-79fcb69799e8.image.png?v=1619191609059">
  <div class="box9">
    <p>
    There is a lot of controversy towards many Muslims and Islam around the world in today's society... But really Islam is a complete religion and the faith of each Muslim is very practical. 
    </p>
 <p>
Each Muslim never prays to hurt or harm anything! They are praying to Allah and praising his attributes and creation but also if we need anything or we have a moment of difficulty we turn to Allah always...
So... now I will briefly explain the simple life of all Muslims around the world!
    </p> 

   <p>
Firstly, each Muslim wakes up before sunrise and remembers Allah by reading Fajr Prayer. 

    </p>
   
  <p>
Before each prayer, each Muslim must be in a state of cleanliness following the Islamic way. This is called wudu. This involves washing the left hand three times up to the wrist, washing out the mouth, nose, and face, the lower arms, the head, the ears, and the feet.
    </p>

<p>
After this, the person can perform their prayer and then continue with beginning their day...
    </p>
    <p>
Most people would then go to work, university /school/college etc. 
By early afternoon, The next prayer Zhur arrives and the same procedure follows with the cleanliness before a Muslim can pray... 
    </p>
  
  <p>  
Many hours into the sunset the next prayer asr takes place and then after sunset Magrib. finally, an hour or two after Magrib prayer Isha takes place...
</p>  
 <p>
And again same procedure takes place with the cleanliness
If we fail to do this before prayer, the prayers will not be accepted...
Also when we read the Holy Quran we must be pure, If we are free at home we read the Quran. Any Muslim can read the Quraan at any time providing he/she is clean.
    </p>   
    <p>
      Now, We all get busy as Muslims with our own lives. But for whatever reason, we have to pray and make up for the prayer. 
    </p>
<p>
  By doing this every day consistently, we feel so much internal peace and also our day feels much more productive and all our duties are fulfilled. 
What has been outlined is the fundamentals. Of course, there is much more depth of a Muslim life. However, this is the spine of being a Muslim daily day in day out!
